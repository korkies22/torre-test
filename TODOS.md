# TODOS

Here are some ideas that I think, would make the app much better:

- Unit testing, and CI/CD. This is currently something I have a lot of interest in learning but haven't got the opportunity to do it
- Check security. Most APIs are secure. The most insecure part of the app that I can think of is the web socket. Maybe with some time I can think of an strategy of implementing it, maybe by sending the token when first connecting.
- Groups editing and deliting. Basic CRUD, could do it but decided to invest my time in more interesting and different features for showcasing purposes.
- Group confirmation by other members.
- In general, enriching the group page; for example with skills, projects and similar things.
- Optimizing loading, for example with lazy images, lazy components, etc.
- Of course, investing time in accesibility. Testing accesibility settings for example with axe. This includes the capacity of using the web page only with a keyboard
- Trying more "error cases"
