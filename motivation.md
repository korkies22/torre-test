# Motivation

Even though I have great abilities at programming, algorithms, technology and logic in general. I can't say that the biggest things I've made, I did them alone.

When I read about Alexander Torrenegra and how he built a lot of things with his now wife, it can only remind me about me and my partner in life, Juliana Prieto (jprietoarcila in Torre).
She is my complement in literally everything. Since I was a child I focused mostly on hard skills. That's why I am very efficient at programming and other things. However, I struggle the most at handling people and having artistic skills (something that has improved tons in the last few years). On the other hand, she has been focused most part of her life into developing soft skills. That's why she creates the most beautiful designs, creates the best documents and documentation for code and knows how to watch out for details, understand clients, requirements and getting networking.
I consider myself a "machine", in fact that's the motto I use most of the time when I need to get something done very fast "I am a machine, I can with everything". However, a machine is nothing without purpose, and nowadays form is as important (if not most) as content.

I know that we 2 perform the work of 3 people, and perform it very happily and motivated in the meantime. This is why, when I knew Torre.co, one of the first things that came into my mind was "I would love to apply to a job with her". And this is why I made this app. I think it would be amazing if you could create your own groups with your best work partners, and apply to a job together. This allows the opportunity to offer a company some skills that arrive only as a synergy; like if I applied with my partner and could offer "design, detail, logical skills, efficiency and organization" in the same appliance.

All in all, I think that this is a feature that could be a differentiating factor for torre. And I will happily for it or for any other that makes the system better.
