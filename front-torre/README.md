# Front torre

This contains the frontend for the torre-test web dev challenge

It uses the vuetify package for that material design look.
It also uses stylelint and sass for better css handling

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project

```
