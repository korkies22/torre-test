# Front torre

This contains the frontend for the torre-test web dev challenge

Almost all css is custom.
All designs are custom, my priority was simplicity, specially concerning implementation.
It also uses stylelint and sass for better css handling.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:4000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
